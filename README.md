## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to install and run the app locally.

1. Get ensured you have node.js installed. App is developed under node v20.14.0. It does not mean this is the only version you may use; you can try any version, especially higher one, but if you met any accidental issues during setup or launch, you can try v20.14.0 in order to avoid those issues.

2. Install the necessary dependencies in "client" folder:

```bash
cd client
npm i
```

3. In separated terminal install the necessary dependencies in "api" folder:

```bash
cd api
npm i
```

4. Make sure you have ".env" file in "api" folder.

5. Start client development server (do it under "client" folder):

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. In separated terminal start API development server (do it under "api" folder):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running locally at http://localhost:5173.
